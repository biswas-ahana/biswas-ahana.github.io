<!--## About Me -->

<!-- I'm a third-year Information Science PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh working with [Prof. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/). My research explores how individuals interact and behave in digital spaces, focusing on what captures people’s attention online, how information spreads, and how communities form and evolve within cyber-social spaces. I study the role of network structures in shaping online behaviors and social dynamics, using Machine Learning and NLP methods to analyze large-scale datasets from platforms such as Twitter/X, Facebook, and TikTok. A key part of my work involves drawing causal inferences from observational data to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving these digital interactions. I am also deeply interested in the ethical dimensions of AI, particularly in addressing algorithmic bias and promoting fairness in socio-technical systems. Through my research, I aim to generate insights into how people engage in online communities while contributing to developing more responsible and interpretable AI systems. -->

My research investigates the structure and dynamics of online communication within large-scale, algorithmically mediated environments. I examine how platform architectures, ranking systems, and social feedback mechanisms shape patterns of visibility, interaction, and discourse, with a particular focus on political communication, toxicity, and audience responsiveness.

My work integrates computational social science with causal inference, natural language processing, and network analysis to study multimodal datasets from platforms such as TikTok, Twitter/X, and Facebook. I develop empirical approaches for identifying the mechanisms through which content gains traction and for understanding how user behavior and algorithmic curation interact to influence information flows and collective attention. This includes analyzing cross-partisan exchanges, amplification dynamics, and the emergence and evolution of narratives across different media ecosystems.

More broadly, I aim to advance theoretical and methodological understanding of socio-technical systems by linking micro-level communicative behaviors with macro-level patterns of online discourse. I am also developing new lines of inquiry on how AI-mediated interfaces and LLM-driven communication tools reshape participation, conversational norms, and public expression.

My research has been published in venues such as ICWSM and HKS Misinformation Review, and presented at conferences and workshops across computational social science, network science, and human–AI communication.

## Research

My research examines how communication unfolds within large-scale, algorithmically mediated environments and how platform structures shape what people see, engage with, and respond to online. I focus on the mechanisms through which visibility, social feedback, and ranking systems influence discourse, engagement, and the formation of political narratives. My work spans three interconnected areas:

### **1. Online Discourse, Visibility, and Social Feedback**
I study how content gains visibility and how audience reactions—likes, comments, shares—reinforce or reshape communication dynamics. This includes work on cross-partisan interactions, toxic amplification, and elite–audience behavior across TikTok, Twitter/X, and Facebook.

- **Political Elites in the Attention Economy (ICWSM 2025)**  
  A network- and causally informed analysis examining how visibility signals and audience responses shape political elites’ communication incentives.

- **Cross-Partisan Interaction Dynamics (ICWSM 2026 under review)**  
  A longitudinal study of how engagement with cross-partisan posts affects future interactions, using matching-based causal inference and visibility-feedback modeling.

### **2. Causal Inference in Socio-Technical Systems**
I develop and apply causal frameworks to uncover mechanisms driving online engagement and information flow, linking micro-level behavior with macro-level patterns of discourse.

- **Toxic Politics & TikTok Engagement (HKS Misinformation Review, 2025)**  
  A multimodal causal analysis investigating how toxicity interacts with algorithmic amplification and user engagement during the 2024 U.S. election.

- **Political Narratives in Crisis Events (SBP-BRiMS 2023)**  
  Narrative and temporal modeling of discourse evolution during the Russia–Ukraine conflict, examining how geopolitical events structure online conversations.

### **3. AI-Mediated Communication and LLM-Driven Interaction**
I examine how emerging AI systems—particularly large language models—reshape online communication, coordination, and public expression. My work explores how AI agents participate in, mediate, or influence discourse, and how human–AI interaction alters conversational norms and visibility dynamics in digital publics.

Current research directions include:
- **LLM-Mediated Dialogue and Conflict Resolution**  
  Designing controlled experiments where LLMs intervene in polarized online discussions—either as mediators or as co-participants—to test how AI-generated suggestions influence tone, cooperation, and conversational outcomes.

- **Agent-Based Simulations with LLM-Generated Communication Styles**  
  Using LLMs to generate diverse rhetorical, affective, or strategic communication patterns and embedding them in simulation environments to model how AI-augmented messages diffuse through networks, shape engagement, and influence narrative evolution.

These projects position LLMs as **active communicative agents**, revealing how AI participation reshapes discourse structures, user behavior, and the evolution of digital public spheres.

## About Me

I am a PhD student in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by [Prof. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/). My research investigates the structure and dynamics of online communication in large-scale, algorithmically mediated environments. I study how visibility signals, ranking systems, and social feedback mechanisms shape political discourse, toxicity, and audience responsiveness across platforms such as TikTok, Twitter/X, and Facebook.

My work integrates computational social science, causal inference, natural language processing, and network analysis to understand how content gains traction and how user behavior interacts with algorithmic curation. I analyze cross-partisan exchanges, amplification pathways, and the emergence and evolution of narratives, with the goal of uncovering mechanisms that explain collective attention and communicative behavior online.

More broadly, I aim to link micro-level user interactions with macro-level patterns of discourse to advance theoretical understanding of socio-technical systems. I am also developing new lines of research on how AI-mediated interfaces and LLM-driven communication tools reshape participation, conversational norms, and public expression.

My research has been published in venues such as **ICWSM** and the **Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review**, and presented at conferences and workshops across computational social science, network science, and human–AI communication.

## Research Areas

    <summary>
      <span class="research-card-title">Online Discourse, Visibility, and Social Feedback</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="research-card-body">
      <p>
      I study how content gains visibility and how audience reactions—likes, comments, shares—reinforce or reshape communication dynamics. This includes work on cross-partisan interactions, toxic amplification, and elite–audience behavior across TikTok, Twitter/X, and Facebook.

        <li><strong>Political Elites in the Attention Economy (ICWSM 2025)</strong>: A network- and causally informed analysis examining how visibility signals and audience responses shape political elites’ communication incentives.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Partisan Interaction Dynamics (ICWSM 2026 under review)</strong>: A longitudinal study of how engagement with cross-partisan posts affects future interactions, using matching-based causal inference and visibility-feedback modeling.</li>

    <div class="research-card-body">
      <p>
      I develop and apply causal frameworks to uncover mechanisms driving online engagement and information flow, linking micro-level behavior with macro-level patterns of discourse.

        <li><strong>Political Narratives in Crisis Events (SBP-BRiMS 2023)</strong>: Narrative and temporal modeling of discourse evolution during the Russia–Ukraine conflict, examining how geopolitical events structure online conversations.</li>

    </summary>
    <div class="research-card-body">
      <p>
      I examine how emerging AI systems—particularly large language models—reshape online communication, coordination, and public expression. My work explores how AI agents participate in, mediate, or influence discourse, and how human–AI interaction alters conversational norms and visibility dynamics.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LLM-Mediated Dialogue and Conflict Resolution</strong>: Controlled experiments where LLMs intervene in polarized discussions—either as mediators or co-participants—to test how AI-generated suggestions influence tone, cooperation, and conversational outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Agent-Based Simulations with LLM-Generated Communication Styles</strong>: Using LLMs to generate diverse rhetorical and affective communication patterns and embedding them in simulation environments to model how AI-augmented messages diffuse through networks and shape engagement and narrative evolution.</li>

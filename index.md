<!--## About Me -->

<!-- I'm a third-year Information Science PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh working with [Prof. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/). My research explores how individuals interact and behave in digital spaces, focusing on what captures people’s attention online, how information spreads, and how communities form and evolve within cyber-social spaces. I study the role of network structures in shaping online behaviors and social dynamics, using Machine Learning and NLP methods to analyze large-scale datasets from platforms such as Twitter/X, Facebook, and TikTok. A key part of my work involves drawing causal inferences from observational data to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving these digital interactions. I am also deeply interested in the ethical dimensions of AI, particularly in addressing algorithmic bias and promoting fairness in socio-technical systems. Through my research, I aim to generate insights into how people engage in online communities while contributing to developing more responsible and interpretable AI systems. -->

<!-- I am a PhD student in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by [Prof. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/). My research investigates the structure and dynamics of online communication within large-scale, algorithmically mediated environments. I examine how platform architectures, ranking systems, and social feedback mechanisms shape patterns of visibility, interaction, and discourse, with a particular focus on political communication, toxicity, and audience responsiveness.

My work integrates computational social science with causal inference, natural language processing, and network analysis to study multimodal datasets from platforms such as TikTok, Twitter/X, and Facebook. I develop empirical approaches for identifying the mechanisms through which content gains traction and for understanding how user behavior and algorithmic curation interact to influence information flows and collective attention. This includes analyzing cross-partisan exchanges, amplification dynamics, and the emergence and evolution of narratives across different media ecosystems.

More broadly, I aim to advance theoretical and methodological understanding of socio-technical systems by linking micro-level communicative behaviors with macro-level patterns of online discourse. I am also developing new lines of inquiry on how AI-mediated interfaces and LLM-driven communication tools reshape participation, conversational norms, and public expression.

My research has been published in venues such as ICWSM and HKS Misinformation Review, and presented at conferences and workshops across computational social science, network science, and human–AI communication.

## About Me

I am a PhD student in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by [Prof. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/). My research investigates the structure and dynamics of online communication in large-scale, algorithmically mediated environments. I study how visibility signals, ranking systems, and social feedback mechanisms shape political discourse, toxicity, and audience responsiveness across platforms such as TikTok, Twitter/X, and Facebook.

My work integrates computational social science, causal inference, natural language processing, and network analysis to understand how content gains traction and how user behavior interacts with algorithmic curation. I analyze cross-partisan exchanges, amplification pathways, and the emergence and evolution of narratives, with the goal of uncovering mechanisms that explain collective attention and communicative behavior online.

More broadly, I aim to link micro-level user interactions with macro-level patterns of discourse to advance theoretical understanding of socio-technical systems. I am also developing new lines of research on how AI-mediated interfaces and LLM-driven communication tools reshape participation, conversational norms, and public expression.

My research has been published in venues such as **ICWSM** and the **Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review**, and presented at conferences and workshops across computational social science, network science, and human–AI communication.

## Research Overview

### **Online Discourse & Algorithmic Visibility**
I study how platform design, ranking systems, and audience feedback shape visibility, interaction patterns, and elite–audience dynamics. This includes work on toxicity, cross-partisan communication, and amplification loops in political networks.

### **Causal Inference in Socio-Technical Systems**
I develop and apply causal frameworks to observational social data to identify mechanisms that drive engagement, visibility, and user behavior.

### **AI-Mediated Interfaces & LLM-Driven Communication**
I examine how AI systems—such as LLM-based interfaces and content-generation tools—reshape online participation, discourse norms, and the organization of digital publics.

---

## Selected Projects

### **Toxic Politics & TikTok Engagement (HKS Misinformation Review, 2025)**
Large-scale multimodal analysis of political TikTok content during the 2024 U.S. election to understand how toxicity interacts with engagement and platform dynamics.

### **Political Elites in the Attention Economy (ICWSM 2025)**
Network- and causally informed analysis of how elite visibility is shaped by audience reactions—revealing the asymmetric incentives embedded within social media platforms.

### **Cross-Partisan Interaction Dynamics (ICWSM 2026 under review)**
Longitudinal analysis of how cross-partisan engagement affects future communication patterns, using matching-based causal estimation and visibility feedback modeling.

### **AI-Mediated Job Matching (Industry Internship)**
Developing human-understandable counterfactual explanations for AI-driven candidate–job matching models and examining how users interact with explanation interfaces.

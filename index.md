## ABOUT ME

<!-- I'm a third-year Information Science PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh working with [Prof. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/). My research explores how individuals interact and behave in digital spaces, focusing on what captures people’s attention online, how information spreads, and how communities form and evolve within cyber-social spaces. I study the role of network structures in shaping online behaviors and social dynamics, using Machine Learning and NLP methods to analyze large-scale datasets from platforms such as Twitter/X, Facebook, and TikTok. A key part of my work involves drawing causal inferences from observational data to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving these digital interactions. I am also deeply interested in the ethical dimensions of AI, particularly in addressing algorithmic bias and promoting fairness in socio-technical systems. Through my research, I aim to generate insights into how people engage in online communities while contributing to developing more responsible and interpretable AI systems. --> 

I’m a PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh working at the intersection of Computational Social Science and Responsible AI, advised by [Prof. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/). I work on understanding online discourse and engagement dynamics --- a key part of my research involves drawing causal inferences from observational data to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving digital interactions. I am also deeply interested in the ethical dimensions of AI, particularly in addressing algorithmic bias and promoting fairness in socio-technical systems. Through my research, I aim to generate insights into how people engage in online communities while contributing to developing more responsible and interpretable AI systems.
